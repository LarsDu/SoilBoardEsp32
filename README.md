# SoilBoardEsp32

A custom PCB for the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 designed for WiFi enabled automated plant watering, and optionally making a wheeled robot of some sort.

Certain parts of the circuit schematic were sourced/adapted from the [LiteWing](https://github.com/Circuit-Digest/LiteWing/tree/main) open source drone project.
